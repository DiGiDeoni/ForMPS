    FortranMPS is a library for Tensor Network Algorithms written in Fortran 2003.
    
    You need a Fortran 2003 compiler such as Intel Fortran Compiler (version 11.1.088 or above).
    As of july 2010, the gfortran compiler is close to having all the features needed for FortranMPS. 
    
    In order to run the test units for FortranMPS you need to have installed 
    FUnit from NASA, http://nasarb.rubyforge.org/
